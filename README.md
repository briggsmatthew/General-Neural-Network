# General Neural Network

A basic neural network designed in Python with numpy.

The file `main.py` provides the `NeuralNetwork` class which allows a user to
initialize a network with any number of layers and nodes. After training (ie. 
using the `train_from_file` function), the user can use the `interact` function
to get an outcome from the network, displaying the confidence of each output
node.
